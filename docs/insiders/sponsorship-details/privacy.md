- Privacy of sponsorings
- How to sponsor privately

----

- Recommended Workflow:
  - 1. Create a new GitHub bot account specifically for this purpose – this bot account should not be associated with any individual and should be set as a privately listed owner within your GitHub organization.
  - 2. Use this account to sponsor Material for MkDocs privately – the account will be automatically listed as a collaborator on the private Insiders repository.
  - 3. [Clone], [fork], or [mirror] the repository as needed.

[__Will you sign an NDA for sponsorships?__](#nda){ #nda }

Unfortunately, we cannot sign any NDA or vendor agreement form. As a small team
working on Material for MkDocs, we have limited resources and cannot review
and sign agreements.

[__Will you fill out our companys forms?__](#forms){ #forms }

To dedicate more time and resources to the development of our projects, we have
implemented measures to minimize administrative overhead for our small team. As
part of this approach, we have adopted GitHub Sponsors to efficiently handle all
transactions for us. Consequently, we have decided to introduce a setup fee for
any additional administrative tasks other than those handled by GitHub Sponsors
that require our attention and involve the completion of forms or adherence to
company processes when purchasing Material for MkDocs Insiders. If your purchase
department requires additional time and effort from our team, please be aware
that the setup fee will apply. For detailed information and specific inquiries,
please reach out to us at sponsors@squidfunk.com.

[__Can I sponsor privately?__](#sponsorship-private){ #sponsorship-private }

Yes, you can. GitHub offers the option to [set your sponsorship to private] when
you initiate your sponsorship. This means that your account will not appear in
sponsor-listings so there is no public affiliation with Material for MkDocs.
Only we know that you sponsored, but we will never disclose this information
without your written consent.

[__Are there any geographical restrictions on becoming a sponsor?__](#sponsorship-geo){ #sponsorship-geo }

No, there are no geographical restrictions for becoming a sponsor. We welcome
sponsorships from individuals and organizations worldwide. As long as your
credit card is valid and accepted by GitHub you are eligible to become
a sponsor and support the project, regardless of your location.
