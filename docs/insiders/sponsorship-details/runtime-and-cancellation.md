# Runtime and cancellation

## Runtime

- How long is my sponsorship valid?

Your sponsorship is valid for as long as your monthly or yearly subscription
is valid. If you choose to cancel your sponsorship, you will lose access to
the Insiders edition once your cancelation is active and will be automatically
removed by GitHub as a collaborator from the private repository.

## Cancellation process

- How do I cancel my sponsorship?

To cancel your sponsorship, follow the [step-by-step guide] provided by GitHub.
If you sponsored using an organizational account, please ensure that you cancel
your sponsorship using the same organizational account rather than your
individual account.

### Effects of cancellation

- What happens when I cancel my sponsorship?

If you choose to cancel your subscription to Insiders, you will be
automatically removed by GitHub as a collaborator on the day your cancellation is
effective. From that day on, you will no longer receive future updates. However,
you are __welcome to continue using the latest version__ that was available to
you at the time of your cancellation for as long as you like.

Please note that [GitHub deletes private forks], so you may want to take steps
to ensure that you have a backup of the software if necessary and use the
locally installed version.
