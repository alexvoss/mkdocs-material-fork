[__What constitutes commercial use of the Insiders edition?__](#commercial-use){ #commercial-use }

Commercial use refers to any use of the software for a business or for-profit
purpose. This includes any use by a corporation or other organization, whether
or not they generate revenue directly from the software. We offer different
pricing tiers for commercial use, each tailored to the needs of different
businesses. It's important to note that internal use of the software within your
organization is also considered commercial use, as with all commercial software.

[__What constitutes non-commercial use of the Insiders edition?__](#non-commercial-use){ #non-commercial-use }

[Non-commercial] use of our Material for MkDocs refers to private use. This
includes individuals using the Insiders edition for private or purely
non-commercial Open Source projects. We offer two different tiers for
non-commercial use, depending on the number of sites you want to build.

[__What is your fair use policy?__](#fair-use-policy){ #fair-use-policy }

Our fair use policy includes the following guidelines:

- Please refrain from __distributing the source code__ of Insiders. While you
may use the software for public, private, or commercial projects and may
privately [fork] or [mirror] it, we ask that you keep the source code private. This
is important to our sponsorware strategy, which helps us fund ongoing
development and support of the software. If this guidelines is violated,
everybody loses, as it will reduce the time of us maintainers we can set aside
to push this project forward.

- As our sponsoring tiers are based on the number of sites you want to build,
please make sure to [upgrade your sponsorship] once your current sponsoring tier
limit has been reached.

[__Does the Insiders edition have a different license?__](#insiders-license){ #insiders-license }

No. Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use Material for
MkDocs Insiders precisely under the same terms as Material for MkDocs, which are
given by the [MIT license].
