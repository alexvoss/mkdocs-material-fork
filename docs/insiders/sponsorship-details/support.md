## Sponsoring support

- How can I contact support if I have questions about becoming a sponsor?

If you have any questions and would like to contact us before starting your
sponsorship, we are happy to answer all your non-technical questions about the
Insiders program via email at sponsors@squidfunk.com.

All technical questions should be asked openly on our [discussion board].


## Technical support

### Issue Tracker

- Is additional support available for Material for MkDocs Insiders users?

Yes, we provide non-technical support related to sponsoring at
sponsors@squidfunk.com. For technical questions, please submit an issue openly
on our [issue tracker] or start a discussion on our [discussion board]. Issues
and discussions from our organizational sponsors, sponsoring on
__The Organization__ tier or higher will be prioritized.[^1]

  [^1]:
    Priority support means we will prioritize your issue, meaning we will look
    into it and do our best to solve your issue asap. However, the prioritized bug
    support does not mean that we can solve your issue before any others since
    some issues might take more time to solve.

- How can I report a bug in the Insiders edition?

If you encounter a bug in the Insiders edition, we kindly request that you
report it on our [issue tracker] in the public community repository. When
submitting the bug report, please ensure that you do not include any private
Insiders' source code, as we want to uphold our fair use policy.

### Discussion board

- How can I report an issue in my customizations?

Please note, that we do not offer support for customizations as they vary
widely and are specific to individual cases. Our support is primarily focused on
assisting with our core features. When reporting an issue, please remove all
customizations to ensure effective problem diagnosis with a minimal reproduction
[.zip file], as described in our bug reporting guide. Our [built-in info plugin],
which is essential when creating a reproduction, will not function correctly
with customizations in place. For questions and issues with customizations,
please use our [discussion board] to engage with the community.
