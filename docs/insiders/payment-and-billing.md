#### Credit Card

## Invoices

Since [GitHub Sponsors] manages all transactions on our behalf, GitHub Sponsors
is considered your supplier, not us. As part of their process, GitHub Sponsors
automatically sends you a payment receipt via email for each billing cycle. It's
important to note that this document is a receipt, not an invoice.


If you
require an invoice for your records, please contact us at sponsors@squidfunk.com
before initiating your sponsorship.

The organization needs to sign the sponsorship agreement which is a 3 year
commitment. The GitHub Invoiced Sponsor Agreement is separate from other services.
The organization needs a minimum spend of 5,000 US dollars (USD) per year on sponsoring.
The organization needs to pay the invoice within 30 days.

## Refunds

[GitHub Sponsors] manages all sponsoring transactions. Because of that, we do
not have any insights into the details of the funds and cannot access them. If
you have any payment issues, please get in touch with the GitHub Sponsors
support team, and they can help you.

- Do you offer free access to Insiders for Open Source projects?

No, we do not offer free access to our Material for MkDocs Insiders edition.
We understand that non-profit organizations may have limited budgets and may
need to prioritize their spending on other projects or organizations. However,
it's important to note that Material for MkDocs is maintained by a small team
that is investing a lot of time and resources into constantly improving this project.
Material for MkDocs and its core features are free to the community through our
Open Source model. Therefore, Material for MkDocs itself is already free.

However, we do offer an affordable sponsorship tier starting at [$15] a month,
which is meant for individuals and non-profit organizations using Material for
MkDocs to build 1-2 sites for [non-commercial] purposes. This tier provides access
to all new features, benefiting you from our ongoing development efforts.

- Is Insiders free for those who contribute to this project?

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Material for MkDocs! We value
every contribution, but it's important to distinguish between different types of
contributions. While minor edits such as typo corrections or adding new
languages are appreciated, they demand significant review efforts that exceed
the scope of such contributions. Consequently, free access to the Insiders
edition is exclusively offered to our [community experts].

If you're passionate about making a significant impact, we encourage you to
explore our [community experts] program. This program is designed for
experienced users eager to share their expertise on our [discussion board]. Our
discussion board facilitates the exchange of insights on workarounds, setups,
and features and addresses queries from users at all levels of experience. As a
community expert, you become an integral part of our project by actively
assisting users and addressing their inquiries. This allows our team to focus
more on enhancing and developing new features – benefiting the entire community.

In acknowledgment of such valuable contributions, active [community experts] are
granted free access to the Insiders edition. This presents a fantastic
opportunity for you to make meaningful contributions while enjoying the perks of
the Insiders edition.

While sponsoring specific goals directly is not possible, our sponsoring goals
are connected to specific features or development goals aligned with the
project's roadmap. You can find an [overview of these sponsoring goals] and their
associated features on our website. Insider users have early access to all
already developed features, including those associated with higher funding goals
that will be reached at a later stage. If you're interested in accessing these
features, becoming a sponsor is the way to go. If you have a feature in mind
that you would like to see on the list, we encourage you to
[initiate a new discussion] to evaluate it with others.

## Billing cycle

The [billing cycle] is an account-level setting on GitHub and is set to monthly
or yearly, according to your preference. You can change your billing cycle in
your account setting at any time. Before you sponsor Material for MkDocs on one
of our sponsoring tiers, you can change your [billing cycle] to either monthly
or yearly, according to your preference.

If you find it challenging to make this change in your account, a practical
workaround is to create a dedicated GitHub bot account where you set the billing
cycle to yearly and use it specifically for your sponsorship contributions. This
is a strategy some of our sponsors have successfully implemented. For any
difficulties or further inquiries, please don’t hesitate to contact us at
sponsors@squidfunk.com for support.

## One-time payment

One-time donations, while appreciated, cannot support the ongoing development of
Material for MkDocs as subscriptions do. Our project's growth relies on steady
support from subscriptions to fund new features, updates, and maintenance.
Therefore, the Insiders version is not available through a one-time donation.

If monthly payments do not work for you or your company, you can adjust your
GitHub account's billing cycle to annual instead of monthly and sponsor at the
appropriate tier.

Why are one-time sponsorships not granted access to Insiders?

We use GitHub webhooks to determine our current active sponsors. When you create
or cancel your monthly subscription, GitHub sends events that we use to
automatically add and remove collaborators.

Note that [$15 a month] is the minimum amount to be granted access to Insiders.
