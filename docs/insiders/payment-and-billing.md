# Payment and billing

Material for MkDocs relies on [GitHub Sponsors] for the management of our
sponsorships and all transactions. As we host our repositories, including both
the Material for MkDocs community edition and the private Insiders edition,
GitHub Sponsors is our chosen platform for handling all financial transactions
and for access management to the private Material for MkDocs Insiders repository.
Therefore, to become a sponsor of Material for MkDocs, a [GitHub account]
is mandatory.

## Payment

GitHub Sponsors currently only accepts payments via credit card, as they
[stopped support for other payment options] at the beginning of 2023. When
entering your credit card details, ensure that the card remains [valid over an
extended period] to prevent any disruptions to your sponsorship.

## Invoices

GitHub Sponsors automatically issues and send a payment receipt via email after
each billing cycle. These receipts serve as confirmation of payment rather than
formal invoices. As all transactions are managed by [GitHub Sponsors], GitHub is
your primary point of contact for payment and billing matters, not us. Should
you need an official invoice from us for your records, please get in touch with us at
sponsors@squidfunk.com before initiating your sponsorship.

## Refunds

Our team does not have insights or access to details related to sponsorship
transactions of our sponsors, as GitHub does not provide us with this
information. For questions regarding payment issues or for more detailed
information about your sponsorship, please get in touch with the [GitHub
support] team.

## Discounts

We can not offer discounts on Material for MkDocs Insiders. To ensure that
everyone in our community can afford to become a sponsor of Material for
Insiders, we keep the barrier low and set prices as low as possible â€“ starting
at $[15 a month] for [non-commercial use] and at $[125 a month] for
[commercial use].

## Billing cycle

The [billing cycle] is an account-level setting on GitHub and is set to monthly
or yearly. It can be changed at any time, so you might want to check the setting
before sponsoring and change it either monthly or yearly according to your own
or your company's preferences.

Suppose you find it challenging to make this change in your account. In that
case, a practical workaround is to create a dedicated [GitHub bot account] where
you set the billing cycle to yearly and use it specifically for your sponsorship
contributions. This is a strategy some of our sponsors have successfully
implemented. For any difficulties or further inquiries, please don't hesitate to
contact us at sponsors@squidfunk.com for additional support.
