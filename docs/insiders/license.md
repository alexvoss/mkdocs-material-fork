## Fair use policy

Our fair use policy ensures the project continues to thrive, which is
why we request that our sponsors respect the following:

-   __Source Code Distribution__ – Keeping our Sponsorware model intact means we
    trust you not to distribute the Insiders source code. While you're encouraged
    to privately [fork] or [mirror] the private Insiders repository according to
    your needs, __keeping the source private__ is key.

-   __Sponsorship tiers__ – We offer different tiers for non-commercial and
    commercial use – please respect this and choose the apporpriate tier for
    your use case. If you're unsure which tier to choose, please contact us
    at sponsors@squidfunk.com.

    Additionally, our sponsoring tiers are structured according to the number
    of projects you want to build. Please upgrade your sponsorship if you exceed
    the number of projects allowed by your current tier to support the project’s
    growth and ensure its continued development.
