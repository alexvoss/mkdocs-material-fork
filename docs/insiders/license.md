## Fair use policy

Our fair use policy includes the following guidelines:

- Please refrain from __distributing the source code__ of Insiders. While you
may use the software for public, private, or commercial projects and may
privately [fork] or [mirror] it, we ask that you keep the source code private. This
is important to our sponsorware strategy, which helps us fund ongoing
development and support of the software. If this guidelines is violated,
everybody loses, as it will reduce the time of us maintainers we can set aside
to push this project forward.

- As our sponsoring tiers are based on the number of sites you want to build,
please make sure to [upgrade your sponsorship] once your current sponsoring tier
limit has been reached.
