The sponsoring tiers are divided into [non-commercial] and [commercial] tiers. If
you are an individual or organization using Material for MkDocs for private or
__non-commercial__ Open Source projects, you have two tiers to choose from,
depending on the number of sites you want to build. For companies using
Material for MkDocs, we offer three different __commercial__ tiers, from which
you can choose depending on your requirements.

Also, please read what is considered [commercial use].
