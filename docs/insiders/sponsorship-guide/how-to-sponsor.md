# How to become a sponsor

New features are added every other week. Be sure to come back.

Thanks for your interest in sponsoring! In order to become an eligible sponsor
with your GitHub account, visit [squidfunk's sponsor profile], and complete
a sponsorship of __$15 a month or more__. You can use your individual or
organization GitHub account for sponsoring.

__Important__: If you're sponsoring @squidfunk through a GitHub organization,
please send a short email to sponsors@squidfunk.com with the name of your
organization and the GitHub account of the individual that should be added as a
collaborator.[^4]

You can cancel your sponsorship anytime.[^5]

  [^4]:
    It's currently not possible to grant access to each member of an
    organization, as GitHub only allows for adding users. Thus, after
    sponsoring, please send an email to sponsors@squidfunk.com, stating which
    account should become a collaborator of the Insiders repository. We're
    working on a solution which will make access to organizations much simpler.
    To ensure that access is not tied to a particular individual GitHub account,
    create a bot account (i.e. a GitHub account that is not tied to a specific
    individual), and use this account for the sponsoring. After being added to
    the list of collaborators, the bot account can create a private fork of the
    private Insiders GitHub repository, and grant access to all members of the
    organizations.

  [^5]:
    If you cancel your sponsorship, GitHub schedules a cancellation request
    which will become effective at the end of the billing cycle. This means
    that even though you cancel your sponsorship, you will keep your access to
    Insiders as long as your cancellation isn't effective. All charges are
    processed by GitHub through Stripe. As we don't receive any information
    regarding your payment, and GitHub doesn't offer refunds, sponsorships are
    non-refundable.
