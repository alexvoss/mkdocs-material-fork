# Material for MkDocs Insiders

- Why did we create Material for MkDocs Insiders?

Material for MkDocs began as a passion project, which we
made open-source to share freely with everyone. However, as the project's
popularity grew over the last few years, so did the demands of its maintenance
and overhead. Faced with the growing demands and the tough choice between
discontinuing our efforts or dedicating ourselves full-time, we chose to commit
ourselves fully to the project.

To sustain this full-time commitment and to expand the team, we introduced
Material for MkDocs Insiders. This private Insiders repository, available
exclusively to our monthly sponsors, is where we first release the latest
advancements of Material for MkDocs. That way our sponsors get the
premium features in advance of all others users as a thank you for their
support. But here's the best part: once we achieve specific funding goals, these
advancements become available to the wider community. This model ensures ongoing
development and accessibility for all, keeping the project vibrant and
up-to-date.

We communicate these funding goals and their progress openly, ensuring our
community is involved every step of the way. It's our way of making sure that
while we do need the support to keep going, everyone will eventually benefit
from the advancements made possible by our sponsors.


## What is Insiders?

Material for MkDocs follows the __sponsorware__ release strategy, which means
that new features are first exclusively released to sponsors as part of
Insiders. Material for MkDocs Insiders is a private fork of Material for MkDocs, hosted as
a private GitHub repository. Almost[^1] all new features what's in it for you
are developed as part of this fork, which means that they are immediately
available to all eligible sponsors, as they are made collaborators of this
repository.

  [^1]:
    In general, every new feature is first exclusively released to sponsors, but
    sometimes upstream dependencies like [Python Markdown Extensions] enhance
    existing features that must be supported by Material for MkDocs.

Every feature is tied to a funding goal in monthly subscriptions. When a
funding goal is hit, the features that are tied to it are merged back into
Material for MkDocs and released for general availability, making them available
to all users. Bugfixes are always released in tandem.

Sponsorships start as low as __$15 a month__ how to become a sponsor.[^2]

  [^2]:
    Note that $15 a month is the minimum amount to become eligible for
    Insiders. While GitHub Sponsors also allows to sponsor lower amounts or
    one-time amounts, those can't be granted access to Insiders due to
    technical reasons.

- Why is the Insiders offered as a subscription model?

You might wonder why we opted for a subscription model for the Insiders edition
instead of a one-time purchase. Here's the thing: Material for MkDocs is in
constant evolution. Our work is never done because there's always something new
on the horizon â€“ be it adapting to upstream dependency updates, keeping pace
with environment changes like browser updates, or bringing to life
the new features and improvements our users wish for.

A one-time payment might seem appealing at first glance, but it's a bit like
buying a snapshot: great for a moment, but it doesn't stay current for long.
With a subscription, you're not just buying what's already been developed;
you're investing in what's coming next. You get all the future updates, bug
fixes, and new features as they roll out. This ongoing development is crucial
not just for keeping the project alive and kicking but for ensuring it
continues to meet your needs and expectations.

This subscription model is what enables us to dedicate the necessary time and
resources to Material for MkDocs, ensuring its sustainability and growth. It's
about more than just maintaining the status quo; it's about pushing boundaries,
improving, and innovating. When we hit our funding goals through these monthly
subscriptions, we will roll out the Insiders features to the community edition.
That way, the whole community benefits from the advancements made possible by
our supporters.

In essence, the subscription is a commitment to not just maintaining but
actively developing Material for MkDocs. It allows us to plan for the future
with confidence, knowing we have the backing to continue our work. This model
has made all the difference, enabling us to rely on our sponsors' ongoing
support and ensuring that Material for MkDocs remains a cutting-edge tool for
everyone.
