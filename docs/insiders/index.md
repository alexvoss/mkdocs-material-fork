# Insiders

If you want to get the best out of Material for MkDocs, Insiders is what you're
looking for, as it offers the latest and greatest features and enhancements. By
becoming a sponsor, you get to enjoy those before everybody else, and help us
continue to do the best of our work.

## What is Insiders?

Material for MkDocs Insiders is a private fork of Material for MkDocs, hosted as
a private GitHub repository. Almost[^1] [all new features][what's in it for you]
are developed as part of this fork, which means that they are immediately
available to all eligible sponsors, as they are made collaborators of this
repository.

  [^1]:
    In general, every new feature is first exclusively released to sponsors, but
    sometimes upstream dependencies like [Python Markdown Extensions] enhance
    existing features that must be supported by Material for MkDocs.

Every feature is tied to a [funding goal] in monthly subscriptions. When a
funding goal is hit, the features that are tied to it are merged back into
Material for MkDocs and released for general availability, making them available
to all users. Bugfixes are always released in tandem.

Sponsorships start as low as [$15 a month].[^2]

    Note that $15 a month is the minimum amount to become eligible for
    Insiders. While GitHub Sponsors also allows to sponsor lower amounts or
    one-time amounts, those can't be granted access to Insiders due to
    technical reasons.
