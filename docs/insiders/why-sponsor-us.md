Why you should become a sponsor

As with all new features, this was developed with the help of the funding from
our amazing sponsors. I would like to thank them once again for allowing me
among a growing number of individuals to work on this project.
If you're using and loving Material for MkDocs, you should consider supporting
us financially. We hope to maintain this project for as long as possible, giving
us the complete freedom to build what _you_ need, no investors to please. Just
useful software.


Sponsorships make this project sustainable, as they buy the maintainers of this
project time – a very scarce resource – which is spent on the development of new
features, bug fixing, stability improvement, issue triage and general support.
The biggest bottleneck in Open Source is time.[^3]

  [^3]:
    Making an Open Source project sustainable is exceptionally hard: maintainers
    burn out, projects are abandoned. That's not great and very unpredictable.
    The sponsorware model ensures that if you decide to use Material for MkDocs,
    you can be sure that bugs are fixed quickly and new features are added
    regularly.

If you're unsure if you should sponsor this project, check out the list of
completed funding goals to learn whether you're already using features that
were developed with the help of sponsorships. You're most likely using at least
a handful of them, thanks to our awesome sponsors!

Your sponsorship directly contributes to the development, maintenance, and improvement of Material for MkDocs. Here's how your support makes a difference:

Innovation: Funding goes towards research, development, and the introduction of new features.
Sustainability: Ensures that Material for MkDocs remains up-to-date, secure, and freely available.
Community Support: Helps us provide timely support and resources to the community, fostering growth and learning.

- How are sponsorship contributions used?

It's vital to recognize that the total sponsorship amount doesn't directly
translate into the funds we have available for use. The way we allocate
sponsorship amounts is detailed as follows:

1.  __Taxes__: Since we provide a service to our sponsors, we're of course
    legally obligated to pay sales tax. This requirement applies to all
    sponsorship contributions, aligning us with standard business practices
    as for the rest of the world.

2.  __Sponsorships__: A significant portion of our funding is redirected to
    upstream projects. This cultivates collaboration and supports the broader
    Open Source ecosystem. Those projects and their maintainers are essential
    for the ongoing development of Material for MkDocs.

3.  __Funds__: We are in the process of forming a team devoted to Material for
    MkDocs and are proactively compensating critical contributors. These
    funds cover various aspects of the project, like the creation of new
    features, bug resolution, support, and sponsor relations.
