## Who we are

We are currently a small team working on Material for MkDocs, which includes
both the community and Insiders editions. The project started with [@squidfunk]
working on it solo, but as funding increases, so does our ability to expand the
team and, therefore, improve the product.

### How it started

Material for MkDocs began as a __personal side project__ by [@squidfunk],
released for others to use as well in February 2016 – this is when Material for
MkDocs was born. Initially, he needed a good documentation tool for his projects
and decided to build something on top of MkDocs, a platform aimed at technical
documentation. Even though there has been several working solutions on the
marked before, he realized the project filled a niche by offering a great
designed theme with multiple functionalities, which were missing at the time in
other projects. As Material for MkDocs grew, so did its functionality and
popularity, driven by community requests.

By the end of 2019, the project reached a critical point where it felt
feature-complete for his needs.


than [@squidfunk]
could afford to give in his spare time while juggling other projects to make a
living. It was the point when it started to shift from a personal project to a
community-driven one, with bug reports, feature, or customization requests
taking over. From this point, it was not just about maintaining a project; it was
about evolving it for others, addressing the community's needs, and adding
features that did not directly benefit the creator or maintainer. This is where
it actually turns into a real job.

Facing the decision to either sees to work on the project in the midturn (which is the fate of most open source project) or to find a sustainable
funding model, [@squidfunk] introduced Material for MkDocs Insiders in early
2020 through a sponsorware model. It was hard, as it barely made any money, fighting for every user

### Sponsorware

The sponsorware model allows us to continually evolve the project. New features
are first developed for the Insiders edition and are accessible to our sponsors
immediately. These features are linked to funding goals; once these goals are
reached, the features are merged into the community edition, making them
available to everyone. This approach not only helps keep the project vibrant and
cutting-edge but also ensures it can continue to meet and exceed the community's
expectations.

### Where we are today

Since we started to monetize Material for MkDocs with the sponsorware approach,
we have accomplished so much that we would not have been able to otherwise. If
you look at the increasing number of releases and stars, you can tell the
turning point – at which [@squidfunk] could step back from working on other
projects and focus on Material for MkDocs.

Thanks to [our sponsors], Material for MkDocs has grown from a one-person
project to a thriving community-supported tool. Sponsorship has enabled us to
focus on innovation, stability, and community support, all of which contribute
to the ongoing improvement and sustainability of the project. Today, we are
funded by over 500+ individuals and organizations.

## Funding

GitHUb sponsors nicht, lieber andere Lösungen hervorheben

Making open source sustainable is hard, takes a lot of time and effort, but can
actually be a way for open source to work in the long run. So, we think GitHub
did a really great job by integrating GitHub Sponsors, which can be a way to
avoid the problem of open source projects being abandoned by their creators or
maintainers due to high demand and the possibility of burning out. GitHub
Sponsors represents a promising direction for open source, offering a way for
individual developers and teams to receive financial support. This model enables
developers to dedicate more time to open source, sparking creativity and
benefiting everyone – this could be the future of open source. This is why we
also want to give you a slight idea of where our funds are going:

1.  __Taxes__: Since we provide a service to our sponsors, we're of course
    legally obligated to pay sales tax. This requirement applies to all
    sponsorship contributions, aligning us with standard business practices
    as for the rest of the world.

2.  __Sponsorships__: A significant portion of our funding is redirected to
    upstream projects. This cultivates collaboration and supports the broader
    Open Source ecosystem. Those projects and their maintainers are essential
    for the ongoing development of Material for MkDocs.

3.  __Funds__: We are a small team alread, but are in the process of forming a
    bigger team devoted to Material for MkDocs and are proactively compensating
    critical contributors. These funds cover various aspects of the project,
    like the creation of new features, bug resolution, support, and sponsor
    relations.
