# Why sponsor us

Material for MkDocs is an Open Source project that is developed and maintained
by a small team of individuals who want to devote as much time as possible to
make it better every day. We need to rely on the financial support of
[our awesome sponsors] who buy us the time to work on it.

## Who we are

While [the project was started] by @squidfunk as a personal side project, the
[Sponsorware] model that the project adopted in 2020 allowed him to build a
small team of amazing individuals around him, [who are now helping him] to
maintain the project, as well as the growing list of sponsors.

### How it started

In 2015, albeit 10 years in the industry, @squidfunk was still quite new to
Open Source. Having just finished his latest Open Source project, he realized
that the project was too complex to be explained in a plain README on GitHub.
He needed a good documentation tool for this project.

After evaluating static site generators in general and Hugo, Sphinx and MkDocs
in particular, he quickly decided that MkDocs seemed a good choice, as it was
specifically aimed at technical project documentation and easy to use.
Unfortunately, all of the available themes looked dated, and since @squidfunk
is a very visual person, he just couldn't convince himself to call it a day.

He needed to build a theme.

Months later, in February 2016, [the first version] of Material for MkDocs was
released. Over the next years, @squidfunk being the sole maintainer, countless
feature requests were implemented and bugs were fixed, allowing the project to
gain popularity and reach almost 3,000 stars on GitHub by the end of 2019. It
still is his most popular project to date.

As the project grew, @squidfunk started to implement feature requests that made
sense from a general perspective, but not for his personal use. This was the
point where the project started to shift from a personal project to a
community-driven one, and began to feel like a second job. Facing the decision
to either cease to work on the project – the fate of many successful Open Source
projects – or to try and make Material for MkDocs his job, @squidfunk decided to
give the [Sponsorware] model a try.

Fast forward 4 years, and Material for MkDocs is a thriving community-supported
and well-funded project, with over 500 sponsors and a growing team, used by
international companies and organizations. Material for MkDocs has outgrown its
original purpose and became so much more than just a theme – a
powerful documentation framework built on top of MkDocs.

### Sponsorware

The Sponsorware model is simple – as a sponsor, you get early access to the
latest and greatest features of Material for MkDocs as part of [Insiders] before
everyone else gets to enjoy them, as you are the one making them possible with
your financial contributions.

Every new feature that lands in [Insiders] is linked to a funding goal with a
specific amount. Once this amount is reached, all of the features that are part
of this funding goal are merged into the community edition, making them
available to everyone. It is that simple.

This approach not only helps keep the project vibrant and cutting-edge but also
ensures it can continue to meet and exceed your expectations.

### Where we are today

Starting in 2020 with the advent of the [Sponsorware] model, Material for MkDocs
has taken off – TODO (# releases in 2016-2019 vs 2020-2024)

We wouldn't have dreamt of where we are today when we started this project,
which was and is only possible because of the financial support of our sponsors.
With all of the features that have been implemented, the bugs that have been
fixed, and the support that has been given, we have accomplished so much that
we would not have been able to otherwise.

Since we started to monetize Material for MkDocs with the sponsorware approach,
we have accomplished so much that we would not have been able to otherwise. If
you look at the increasing number of releases and stars, you can tell the
turning point – at which [@squidfunk] could step back from working on other
projects and focus on Material for MkDocs.

Thanks to [our sponsors], Material for MkDocs has grown from a one-person
project to a thriving community-supported tool. Sponsorship has enabled us to
focus on innovation, stability, and community support, all of which contribute
to the ongoing improvement and sustainability of the project. Today, we are
funded by over 500+ individuals and organizations.

## Funding

GitHUb sponsors nicht, lieber andere Lösungen hervorheben

Making open source sustainable is hard, takes a lot of time and effort, but can
actually be a way for open source to work in the long run. So, we think GitHub
did a really great job by integrating GitHub Sponsors, which can be a way to
avoid the problem of open source projects being abandoned by their creators or
maintainers due to high demand and the possibility of burning out. GitHub
Sponsors represents a promising direction for open source, offering a way for
individual developers and teams to receive financial support. This model enables
developers to dedicate more time to open source, sparking creativity and
benefiting everyone – this could be the future of open source. This is why we
also want to give you a slight idea of where our funds are going:

1.  __Taxes__: Since we provide a service to our sponsors, we're of course
    legally obligated to pay sales tax. This requirement applies to all
    sponsorship contributions, aligning us with standard business practices
    as for the rest of the world.

2.  __Sponsorships__: A significant portion of our funding is redirected to
    upstream projects. This cultivates collaboration and supports the broader
    Open Source ecosystem. Those projects and their maintainers are essential
    for the ongoing development of Material for MkDocs.

3.  __Funds__: We are a small team alread, but are in the process of forming a
    bigger team devoted to Material for MkDocs and are proactively compensating
    critical contributors. These funds cover various aspects of the project,
    like the creation of new features, bug resolution, support, and sponsor
    relations.
