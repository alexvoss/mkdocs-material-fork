Sponsors and therefore adheres to GitHubs policies. If you're curious about the

## Runtime

Sponsorships remain valid as long as monthly or yearly subscriptions are
active and only expire when you cancel the sponsorship or when your [payment
method expires].

  [payment method expires]: #Aautomatic-cancellation

## Cancellation process

Canceling your sponsorship initiates a cancellation request through GitHub,
which is scheduled to take effect at the end of your current billing cycle. This
means you'll retain access to Insiders until the cancellation officially becomes
effective. All charges are processed by GitHub and as we don't receive any
information regarding your payment, we can not provide you with details when
your cancallation will be in place.

### How to cancel

To cancel your sponsorship, please follow the [step-by-step guide from GitHub].
If you have sponsored using an organizational account, ensure that you cancel
the sponsorship under that specific account, as the collaborator and sponsor
accounts may differ.

  [step-by-step guide from GitHub]: https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-sponsors/downgrading-a-sponsorship

### Effects of cancellation

Upon the effective date of your cancellation, GitHub will automatically remove
you as a collaborator from the private Material for MkDocs Insiders repository.
You will no longer receive updates. However, you are welcome to continue using
the latest version available to you at the time of cancellation for as long as
you like.

!!! warning "GitHub deletes private forks"

    Please note that [GitHub deletes private forks], so you may want to take
    steps to ensure that you have a backup of the software if necessary and use
    the locally installed version.

and remove you as a collaborator. Regularly checking your payment method is
recommended to avoid unintended cancellations.
