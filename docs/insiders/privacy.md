## Privacy of sponsorings



## Private sponsorship

GitHub offers the option to [set your sponsorship to private] when you initiate
your sponsorship. This means that your account will not appear in sponsor-
listings so there is no public affiliation with Material for MkDocs. Only we
know that you sponsored, but we will never disclose this information.

  [set your sponsorship to private]: https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/sponsoring-open-source-contributors/managing-your-sponsorship#managing-the-privacy-setting-for-your-sponsorship
  [fork]: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo
  [mirror]: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository

### How to sponsor privatley

Create a new GitHub bot account specifically for this purpose – this bot
account should not be associated with any individual and should be set as a
privately listed owner within your GitHub organization.

Use this account to sponsor Material for MkDocs privately – the account will
be automatically listed as a collaborator on the private Insiders repository.

## Admistrative overhead

To dedicate more time and resources to the development of our projects, we have
implemented measures to minimize administrative overhead for our small team. As
part of this approach, we have adopted GitHub Sponsors to efficiently handle all
transactions for us.

### Forms
Consequently, we have decided to introduce a setup fee for
any additional administrative tasks other than those handled by GitHub Sponsors
that require our attention and involve the completion of forms or adherence to
company processes when purchasing Material for MkDocs Insiders. If your purchase
department requires additional time and effort from our team, please be aware
that the setup fee will apply. For detailed information and specific inquiries,
please reach out to us at sponsors@squidfunk.com.

### Vendor agreements



### NDAs

Unfortunately, we cannot sign any NDAs. As a small team working on Material for
MkDocs, we have limited resources and cannot review and sign agreements.

### Our promise

#### Logo placement

No logo placement without your confirmation. Please note that all our perks,
such as logo placement, are entirely optional and must be explicitly requested
by our sponsors.

#### No Marketing

No marketing your sponsorship in any form. Private means private
