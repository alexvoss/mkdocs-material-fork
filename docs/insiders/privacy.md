# Privacy

At Material for MkDocs, transparency powers our sponsorware model. This
transparency extends to our funding goals, the features we're working towards,
and, importantly, the acknowledgment of our awesome sponsors. As a sponsors
you have the option to support our project either [publicly] or [privately] via
GitHub Sponsors, depending on your preference for visibility.

## Public sponsors

By default, GitHub lists all sponsorships publicly. To sponsor privately, you
must explicitly opt for this option. When sponsoring publily, your GitHub
account will be recognized one a sponsor on [our sponsors page], [squidfunk's
sponsoring page], and within the "sponsorings" section of your GitHub account,
showcasing your support of the GitHubs community.

  [squidfunks sponsoring page]: https://github.com/sponsors/squidfunk?metadata_origin=docs

## Private sponsors

For those preferring discretion, [setting your sponsorship to private] during
the sponsorship initiation process ensures your sponsorship remains unlisted,
keeping your affiliation with Material for MkDocs confidential. This setting can
be adjusted at any time through your GitHub account sponsorship settings.

For companies concerned about being visible as sponsors of any project due to
their privacy ristriction, creating a [GitHub bot account] for sponsorship
purposes is advised. This account, set to sponsor privately, won't be linked to
any individual within your organization and provides an extra layer of anonymity.

## Admistrative requests

To focus on the development of our projects, we aim to reduce administrative
tasks as much as possible for our small team, utilizing GitHub Sponsors for
efficient sponsor management.

### Vendor agreements

Since GitHub Sponsors facilitates our sponsor transactions, they act as your
vendor. For vendor agreements or related queries, especially for organizations
with GitHub enterprise accounts, reaching out to [GitHub Support] is recommended.

### Forms

Understanding the administrative necessities, we've introduced a setup fee for
tasks outside GitHub Sponsors' scope, requiring additional effort from our team,
such as completing forms or adhering to company purchasing processes for
Material for MkDocs Insiders. For further details or inquiries, please reach out
to us at sponsors@squidfunk.com.

### NDAs

Given our limited resources as a small team, we are unable to review and sign
NDAs. We advise those requiring such agreements to consult [our promise] for
reassurance.
