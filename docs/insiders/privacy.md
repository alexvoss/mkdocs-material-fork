# Privacy

At Material for MkDocs, transparency powers our sponsorware model. This
transparency extends to our funding goals, the features we're working towards,
and, importantly, the acknowledgment of our awesome sponsors. As a sponsor,
you have the option to support our project either [publicly] or [privately] via
GitHub Sponsors, depending on your visibility preference.

  [publicly]: #public-sponsors
  [privately]: #private-sponsors

## Public sponsors

By default, GitHub lists all sponsorships publicly. To sponsor privately, you
must explicitly select this option. When sponsoring publicly, your GitHub
account will be listed as part of [our sponsors], @squidfunk's [sponsoring page],
and within the "sponsoring" section of your GitHub account, showcasing your
support for our project.

  [our sponsors]: our-sponsors.md
  [sponsoring page]: https://github.com/sponsors/squidfunk?metadata_origin=docs

## Private sponsors

For those preferring discretion, [setting your sponsorship to private] during
the sponsorship initiation process ensures your sponsorship remains unlisted,
keeping your affiliation with Material for MkDocs confidential. This setting can
be adjusted at any time through your GitHub account sponsorship settings.

For companies concerned about being visible as sponsors of any project due to
their privacy restrictions, creating a [GitHub bot account] for sponsorship
purposes is advised. This account, set to sponsor privately, won't be linked to
any individual within your organization and provides an extra layer of anonymity.

## Administrative requests

To focus on the development of our projects, we aim to reduce administrative
tasks as much as possible for our small team, utilizing GitHub Sponsors for
efficient sponsor management.

### Vendor agreements

Since GitHub Sponsors facilitates our sponsor transactions, they act as your
vendor. For vendor agreements or related queries, especially for organizations
with GitHub enterprise accounts, reaching out to [GitHub Support] is recommended.

  [GitHub Support]: https://github.com/sponsors

### Forms

Understanding the administrative necessities, we've introduced a setup fee for
tasks outside GitHub Sponsors' scope, requiring additional effort from our team,
such as completing forms or adhering to company purchasing processes for
Material for MkDocs Insiders. For further details or inquiries, please reach out
to us at sponsors@squidfunk.com.

### NDAs

Given our limited resources as a small team, we are unable to review and sign
NDAs. We advise those requiring such agreements to consult [our promise] for
reassurance.

  [our promise]: #our-promise

## Our promise

We recognize the importance of privacy for our organizational sponsors,
especially in the absence of formal agreements like NDAs. "Our Promise" is our
assurance of commitment to your confidentiality and discretion.

- __Confidential sponsorship:__ Your choice between public or private
sponsorship is respected to the fullest. For private sponsors, we guarantee your
support remains confidential, ensuring no public disclosure of your sponsorship
status.
- __Logo usage and brand representation:__ Logo display and any form of public
acknowledgment are completely under your control and will only proceed with your
explicit consent. This ensures your brand is represented on your terms.
- __Marketing and communication:__ We commit not to use the details of your
sponsorship for marketing or promotional purposes without your express approval.
Your sponsorship details are guarded with the highest level of confidentiality,
with no unauthorized use or disclosure.
