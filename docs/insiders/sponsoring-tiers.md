## Commercial use

- What constitutes commercial use of the Insiders edition?

Commercial use refers to any use of the software for a business or for-profit
purpose. This includes any use by a corporation or other organization, whether
or not they generate revenue directly from the software. We offer different
pricing tiers for commercial use, each tailored to the needs of different
businesses. It's important to note that internal use of the software within your
organization is also considered commercial use, as with all commercial software.

## Non-commercial use

- What constitutes non-commercial use of the Insiders edition?

Non-commercial use of our Material for MkDocs refers to private use. This
includes individuals using the Insiders edition for private or purely
non-commercial Open Source projects. We offer two different tiers for
non-commercial use, depending on the number of sites you want to build.


- Which sponsoring tier should I choose?

The sponsoring tiers are divided into non-commercial and commercial tiers. If
you are an individual or organization using Material for MkDocs for private or
__non-commercial__ Open Source projects, you have two tiers to choose from,
depending on the number of sites you want to build. For companies using
Material for MkDocs, we offer three different __commercial__ tiers, from which
you can choose depending on your requirements.

Also, please read what is considered [commercial use].
