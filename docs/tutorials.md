# Tutorials

In addition to the basic getting started guides, we offer tutorials that aim to
show how Material for MkDocs can be used in different use cases. In contrast to
the getting started guides or the reference documentation, the tutorials show
the breadth of functionality available with Material for MkDocs but also within
the wider MkDocs ecosystem.

* [MkDocStrings](tutorials/mkdocstrings.md)

## Tutorial Structure

The tutorials guide you through worked examples, so following them you should
gain not only and understanding of how Material for MkDocs can be used but also
a template for your own projects. For convenience, these templates are also
available as [template repositories on GitHub].

<!-- TODO -->
[template repositories on GitHub]: templates.md

Each tutorial is a single page, so use the Table of Contents navigation to move
between numbered steps. They start by mentioning prerequisites and giving an
overview of the content as well as describing the outcomes.

### Instructions

Tutorials contain a mix of explanation, demonstrations, and instructions that you
should follow as you work your way through the individual steps. Those instructions
are shown in the form of admonitions to separate them from the rest of the
tutorial:

!!! example "Instructions to follow"

    Whenever you see a box  like this you know it is time to get hands on and
    apply material just covered as well as reflect on how you would it in your
    work work.

### Tips and warnings

Likewise, helpful tips and warnings appear in boxes of their own:

!!! tip "A hot tip!"

    Tips look like this...

!!! warning "Warning!"

    ...and warnings like this!

## Feeback wanted

The tutorials are a recent addition to our documentation and we are still
working out what shape they should have in the end. Please contact us if you
want to provide feedback. <!--- TODOD: how? -->

Note, however, that suggestions should be specific and feasible. We want to
focus on creating more content instead of developing a specific styling or
behaviour for the tutorials. If there are worthwhile improvements that can
be made through simple customization we are happy to consider those.
